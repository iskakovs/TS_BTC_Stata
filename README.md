# BTC and Gold Price Relationship Analysis in Stata

This project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold prices using advanced time series tools in Stata. By leveraging techniques such as Engle-Granger causality tests and cointegration tests, we seek to uncover potential long-term relationships and dependencies between these two assets.

## Project Overview

1. **Data collection and preprocessing**: Obtain historical price data for BTC and gold from reliable sources, clean the data, and ensure consistency.

2. **Exploratory data analysis**: Visualize the price trends and statistical characteristics of BTC and gold to gain insights into their behavior.

3. **Engle-Granger causality test**: Determine if there is a causal relationship between BTC and gold prices, exploring whether one asset's price movements predict or influence the other.

4. **Cointegration analysis**: Investigate the presence of a long-term relationship between BTC and gold, examining whether their prices move together over time.

5. **Other relevant time series analyses**: Utilize additional advanced techniques such as ARIMA modeling, Granger causality tests, or Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, as appropriate.

6. **Interpret and present findings**: Analyze the results obtained from the analyses and provide meaningful insights into the relationship between BTC and gold prices.

## How to Use the Project

1. Install Stata software (version 16 or higher) on your computer.

2. Obtain the necessary historical price data for BTC and gold from reliable sources and save it in a format compatible with Stata.

3. Load the data into Stata and preprocess it as needed to ensure data consistency and quality.

4. Execute the Stata do-files to perform the Engle-Granger causality tests, cointegration analysis, and other relevant time series analyses.

5. Interpret the results and visualize the findings using appropriate graphs or plots in Stata.

6. Modify and customize the analysis as desired, experimenting with different models or techniques available in Stata's time series analysis capabilities.

7. Document your observations, insights, and conclusions based on the analysis.

8. Feel free to contribute improvements, bug fixes, or additional analysis methods to enhance the project.
